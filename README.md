# FastFrames

FastFrames is a package aimed at processing ntuples produced by [TopCPToolkit](/home/tomas/RDataFrame/FastFrames/examples/CustomVariables/install/lib) into histograms or ntuples.
FastFrames rely on ROOT's [RDataFrame](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html) to do the event loop processing.
The code allows users to define their own columns in a minimal way while using all the functionality of the processing.
